                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3.1. Due to our internal policies we only provide the services to users with sufficient experience, knowledge and understanding of the work principles of our Technology Platform and those who fully understand the associated risks. You acknowledge and agree that you shall access and use MintMe at your own risk. The risk of loss in Trading crypto assets can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether such Trading is appropriate for you in light of your circumstances and resources. You acknowledge and agree the possibility of the following:
                        </p>
                        <p class="pl-4">
                            (a) You may sustain a total loss of the crypto assets in your MintMe Account and in some cases you may incur losses beyond such crypto assets.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pl-4">
                            (b) Under certain market conditions you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur for example when the market reaches a daily price fluctuation limit ("limit move") and there is insufficient liquidity in the market.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pl-4">
                            (c) Placing contingent orders such as "stop-loss" or "stop-limit" orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pl-4">
                            (d) All crypto assets positions involve risk, and a "spread" position may not be less risky than an outright "long" or "short" position.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pl-4">
                            (e) The use of leverage can work against you as well as for you and can lead to large losses as well as gains.

                        <p class="pl-4">

You can update your email address at any time by logging into your MintMe Account.

                            6.1. Conditions and Restrictions. We may at any time and in our sole discretion refuse to perform any Transfer requested via MintMe, impose limits on the Transfer amount permitted or impose any other conditions or restrictions upon your use of the Technology Platform without prior notice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            6.2. Access to the Services. We may, in our sole discretion and without liability to you, with or without prior notice and at any time, modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any portion of our Services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            6.3. Cancellations. You may only cancel a Transfer request initiated via MintMe if such cancellation occurs before MintMe executes the Transfer. Once your Transfer request has been executed, you may not change, withdraw or cancel your authorization for MintMe to complete such Transfer. If a Trade order has been partially filled, you may cancel the unfilled remainder unless the order relates to a market rate Trade. We reserve the right to refuse any cancellation request associated with a market rate Trade order once you have submitted such order. While We may at our sole discretion reverse a Trade under certain extraordinary conditions, a customer does not have a right to do a reversal of a Trade.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            6.4. Insufficient Crypto Assets. If you have an insufficient amount of crypto assets in your MintMe Account to complete a Transfer via the Technology Platform, We may cancel the entire order or may fulfill a partial order using the amount of crypto assets currently available in your MintMe Account, less any fees owed to MintMe in connection with our execution of the Transfers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            6.5. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the Transfers you complete via MintMe, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that MintMe is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transfers or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any Trades and Transfers and does not act as your tax agent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            6.6. Feedbacks. We own exclusive rights, including all intellectual property rights, to Feedback. Any Feedback you submit is non-confidential and shall become the sole property of MintMe. We will be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of such Feedback for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you. You waive any rights you may have to the Feedback (including inter alia any copyrights). Do not provide Feedback if you expect to be paid or want to continue to own or claim rights on it; your idea might be great, but We may have already had the same or a similar idea and We do not want disputes. We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any content posted by you constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights or of their right to privacy. We have the right to remove any posting you make on our Platform if in our opinion your post does not comply with the content standards set out therein.

You are solely responsible for backing up and maintaining duplicate copies of any you store or transfer through our services.

                        <p>
                            8.3. Except as otherwise required by law, in no event shall MintMe, our directors, officers, members, employees or agents be liable for any direct, indirect, consequential or special damages, or any other damages of any kind, including, but not limited to, loss of use, loss of profits or loss of data, whether in an action in contract, tort (including but not limited to negligence) or otherwise, arising out of or in any way connected with the use of or inability to use our services or the MintMe IP, including without limitation any damages caused by or resulting from reliance by any user on any information obtained from Us, or that result from mistakes, omissions, interruptions, deletion of files or email, errors, defects, viruses, delays in operation or transmission or any failure of performance, whether or not resulting from a force majeure event, communications failure, theft, destruction or unauthorized access to our records, programs or services.

                        <p>
                            8.4. We resume the right, in our sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding (at our expense) to which We are a participant and determine whether We wish to settle it.

                            8.6. Crypto assets holdings are not covered by any deposit guarantee scheme. As crypto assets payments are not reversible, You are responsible for the protection and security of your MintMe account. The price of crypto assets can change rapidly and the risk of loss in trading or holding crypto assets can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading or holding crypto assets is suitable for you in light of your financial condition, experience and risk tolerance level.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            8.7. We strive to protect our users from fraudulent and scam activities in crypto assets sphere. It is possible that some crypto assets are purposed for unlawful seizure of the property, or are construed as a fraud, scam or any other activity, recognized by the laws as illegal and/or non-compliant with legal requirements. We reserve the right to prohibit and discontinue any transactions on our platform with such crypto asset at our sole discretion, without any prior notice to you and without publication of the reason for such decision, whenever this comes to our knowledge.

Moreover, MintMe represents that it never intended or desired to make tokens and/or coins that can be classified as "security" available via our Technology Platform.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            9.2. The responsibility for the fact that the instrument cannot be treated as “security” lies with the owner of token and/or coin. If there is any risk or speculations that token and/or coin can be treated as “security”, MintMe reserves the right to prohibit and discontinue any transactions on our Technology Platform with such tokens and/or coins at its sole discretion.
