page.index.faq.q1.body: 'Coins are as valuable as you make them, you give them the value because they are a tokenized representation of yourself or your project.'
page.index.faq.q2.header: 'I''ve created a token. How can I give it a real value?'
page.index.faq.q2.body: 'That''s totally up to you. There are many ways to add value to your token. You may have
a service that you offer in which you only accept payment in your token or you might want to
create a reward system for your top supporters that hold a certain amount of your token.
Get as creative as you want, you make the rules.'
page.index.faq.q3.header: 'Why would I accept token instead of USD for my work?'
page.index.faq.q3.body: 'To get money when you need it. You might need tools to start earning, but you have no money
to buy them, so how to start? By allowing potential customers to judge your offer and decide
if you are worth their trust. If your offer will be credible, they could purchase tokens that
will be worth your service, this way you first get tools needed for your work and customers
get the service they needed.'
page.index.faq.q4.header: 'Why would anyone believe in me or my coin?'
page.index.faq.q4.body: 'Because you have developed a reputation for yourself that certainly has value. You are
a valuable asset that can be tokenized as such on the MintMe platform. Your supporters
might also feel more comfortable in being able to benefit later from supporting you now.'
page.index.faq.q5.header: 'Are there any guarantees when I buy other people’s tokens?'
page.index.faq.q5.body: 'No, there are no guarantees when purchasing other people''s tokens. The demand of each token
will solely depend on the buying pressure that the creator generates for their token through
the method of their choosing. There are no guarantees that a certain token will increase in
value just because it was created. We will provide verification tools to check if web pages
and social profiles presented by token creators are official, but we cannot guarantee that
each creator follows through with what they promised or proposed. Honest, ethical and
hard-working creators should eventually be rewarded with large liquid markets that they
have created from zero intrinsic value.'
page.index.faq.q6.header: 'I''m really skeptical about this, what if a token creator is just trying to cheat me out of my money?'
page.index.faq.q6.body: 'With all that has ensued in the markets as of late, we totally understand your concern.
Please be mindful, that it is always important for you to thoroughly conduct proper research
on all token creators you plan to support and never spend more than you are willing to lose.
Also, keep in mind that this is a form of crowdfunding so it might not always be your intention
to even recoup your money. You could simply use this service as a donation platform and keep
your tokens as a souvenirs of proof of early support. You never know, maybe one day the token
creator that received early support from you, might decide to show appreciation for his or her
early supporters and decide to buy back all tokens at a much higher price? The possibilities
are unlimited.'
